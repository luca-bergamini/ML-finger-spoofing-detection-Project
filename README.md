# ML_finger_spoofing_detection-Project
Machine Learning project did for the Machine Learning course at Polytechnic of Turin.

For the realization of this project we apply all the learned, during the course, machine learning tecniques to detect finger spoofing given a dataset.
Each file contain a different tecnique, with its method an a main to test it.
